========== install ==================
 npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk 

========================================================================================

create the following folders and follow these steps

1: store
2: reducers
    - index.js [inside reducers folder, create index.js and put all the combined reducers. You can also do this in the store.js or you can also create separate reducers for each product or actions ]
3: Wrap all root component - App with Provider.
4: types
5: actions



=========================================================

- STORE
=> Inside STORE, create store.js file and import [ createStore, applyMiddleware, compose, combineReducers ] from redux. Also, you can import composeWithDevTools from composeWithDevTools if you want, but if you import composeEnhancer, you should be good to go, but make sure to install composeWithDevTools extension for Google Chrome.
=> in store.js, you need to import all of the reducers of your project such as productsReducer, orderReducer and so forth.


- REDUCERS
 => Inside Reducers folder, create all reducers for your project or application using switch and case by checking each action for every TYPE of action such as FETCH_PRODUCTS & FILER_PRODUCTS_BY_SIZE etc.

- TYPES
  => Inside types [folder], create types.js. In this file, you will need to create all actions for your project such as FETCH_PRODUCTS, FILER_PRODUCTS_BY_SIZE, ORDER_PRODUCTS_BY_PRICE, ADD_TO_CART, REMOVE_FROM_CART, CREATE_ORDER, CLEAR_ORDER, CLEAR_CART and so forth with capital letters because that is the best practice.

- ACTIONS
=> Inside actions folder, create productActions.js file and create fetchProduct function that makes a fetch request to the backend or remote api. This function excepts dispatch as a parameter  and it can be async function. Also, in the dispatch, you need to have two objects, type and payload. The type is the name of the action that you have created inside types.js folder and payload you can set it to the response that is comming from the fetch request if you are using fetch method or axios library.
